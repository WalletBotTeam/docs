# What is WalletBot? 

WalletBot is an advanced Wallet Whitelist Discord bot that is a ton of utility features to support any web 3.0 community. Whether it be NFTs & DAOs or DeFi & GameFi communities, WalletBot provides something useful for everyone. 

The bot's core features are advanced wallet collection, whitelist collab management (and giveaways coming soon!). 

Join the Discord at https://discord.gg/pMXdB6CcnV if you have any questions or would like to see a demo for the bot!

Web 3.0 Community Managers, Mods and Collab Managers will find that that this bot covers almost everything they need in this All-in-One bot. 

WalletBot is a premium bot, which means that you need to purchase a monthly subscription to be able to use the bot. You can also purchase a custom instance (whitelabel) of the bot which allows you to have your own bot profile and request custom features (additionally charged). 

An outline of all the features are shown below. 

### 1. Wallet Collection for Whitelisted users
- Only users with certain roles can submit wallets
- Multiple Panels & Crypto curruncies support (ETH, SOL, etc.)
- Miniumum Crypto balance to submit wallet
- Each panel is independant and can have specfic requirements.
- Give role to users after they’ve submitted
- OG Role for first X wallet submitters
- Auto-remove wallets if user leaves the server

### 2. Auto-whitelist / Collab White list 
- Easiest way to manage Collabs, no more “open ticket to claim `Whitelist` role”
- Automatically assign the whitelisted to specfic users when they join the server
- Auto-whitelist respects Discord’s Rules Screening & any verifcation you have setup with bots. (so users don’t get the `@whitelist` without verifying)
- Assign an additional specfic role for each “auto-whitelist”
- Force run any “auto-whitelist” to add roles to users already in the server
- Get stats for each auto-whitelist: How many auto-whitelisted members joined the server, left the server, in the server but pending verification
- Manage Multiple “auto-whitelists” without anyone ever needing to open a ticket to claim the WL role

### 3. Whitelist Notification to User 
- Informing the user that they’ve received the WL role and can submit their wallet
- No more random “role check” messages in chats
- Pinging with a message in a spefic channel
- Ghost pinging users in the `#submit-wallet` channel (so they can see where to submit their wallet)
- Direct Messaging users that they can submit their wallet and an optional message for them to close their DMs and how to close their DMs (CUSTOM BOT ONLY)

### 4. Whitelist & Wallet Logging 
- Whitelist role logs for seeing when and how users got the Whitelisted role (Assigned by a Staff Member, by which Auto-whitelist or by another bot)
- Whitelist role logs also logs when the Whitelist role is removed from users. (Removed by a staff member, another bot, or user left the server)
- Wallet Logs for seeing the wallet submissions in real real time. Gives information such as their wallet address, current crypto balance, link to ETHERSCAN.
- Wallet logs also show when a users wallet was removed from a Panel due to the wallet being removed by staff member, or if the user left the server.

### 5. Utility Features
- List of users who reacted to a message
- List of users who are mentioned in a message
- List of users who have a specfic role.
- More coming soon.
